I use this blog to post information in a more centralized way, rather than
writing articles across my different projects.

* Current sections
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: current-sections
:END:

The articles in this blog are spread across the following categories.

- [[file:programming/index.org][Programming]]
- [[file:reversing/index.org][Reverse engineering]]
- [[file:naos/index.org][NAOS wiki]]
- [[file:opinion/index.org][Opinion]]
- [[file:reference/index.org][Reference]]

* External articles
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: external-articles-and-documentations
:END:

These are some articles that I have written across my different projects.

- The [[https://github.com/fs-os/fs-os/wiki][fs-os wiki]], explaining the details of [[https://github.com/fs-os/fs-os][my simple operating system]].
- [[https://github.com/8dcc/bms-cheat/wiki/Hooking-CreateMove][Hooking CreateMove]] in the Source 1 game engine.
- Finding offsets and [[https://github.com/8dcc/tf2-cheat/wiki/Getting-SDL-offsets][hooking SDL functions]].

See also:

- The [[https://github.com/8dcc/scratch/tree/main/LaTeX][LaTeX folder]] inside my [[https://github.com/8dcc/scratch][scratch]] GitHub repository has some other articles I
  have written, and also contains some of my [[https://github.com/8dcc/scratch/blob/main/LaTeX/math/math.pdf][math notes]].
- The [[https://github.com/8dcc/scratch][scratch]] repository itself is full of small but interesting projects in
  various languages. All the code is documented.

* Other links and contact
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: external-links
:END:

These are some external links you might find interesting:

- [[https://github.com/sqlait][GitHub]]

* Extra notes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: extra-notes
:END:

Here are some notes that might help when reading or navigating this blog.

- Most pages are static HTML files generated by [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]' [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]], and they can be
  displayed in console browsers such as [[https://lynx.invisible-island.net/][Lynx]] or [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eww.html][EWW]].
- Some articles might use JavaScript for the [[https://www.mathjax.org/][MathJax library]]. When disabled, the
  raw LaTeX code will be displayed.
- There are two types of links: to an external page or site, with a solid
  underline; or to an element of the current page, with a dashed underline.
