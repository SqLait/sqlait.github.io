writing articles across my different projects.

Here are some notes that might help when reading or navigating this blog.

- Most pages are static HTML files generated by [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]' [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]], and they can be
  displayed in console browsers such as [[https://lynx.invisible-island.net/][Lynx]] or [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eww.html][EWW]].
- There are two types of links: to an external page or site, with a solid
  underline; or to an element of the current page, with a dashed underline.
